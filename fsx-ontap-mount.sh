I'll create a simplified version of your FSx mount script that reduces points of failure and adds timeouts to prevent hanging. Here's a streamlined version:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Simplified FSx for NetApp ONTAP Mount Script for SageMaker Hyperpod

# Basic logging to local file only - no CloudWatch dependency
exec > >(tee /var/log/fsx-ontap-mount.log) 2>&1
echo "Starting FSx for NetApp ONTAP mount process at $(date)"

# Configuration variables
FSX_DNS_NAME="YOUR_SVM_DNS_NAME"  # e.g., svm-123456789.fs-123456789.fsx.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
VOLUME_JUNCTION_PATH="/hyperpod"
MOUNT_POINT="/mnt/fsx-ontap"
NFS_OPTIONS="rw,hard,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,timeo=600,retrans=2,noresvport"

echo "Configuration: FSX_DNS_NAME=$FSX_DNS_NAME, MOUNT_POINT=$MOUNT_POINT"

# Install NFS client with timeout
echo "Installing NFS utilities..."
if [ -f /etc/debian_version ]; then
    timeout 120 sudo apt-get update && timeout 120 sudo apt-get install -y nfs-common
    echo "Installed nfs-common (Debian/Ubuntu)"
elif [ -f /etc/redhat-release ]; then
    timeout 120 sudo yum install -y nfs-utils
    echo "Installed nfs-utils (RedHat/CentOS/Amazon Linux)"
else
    echo "Unsupported OS. Continuing anyway..."
fi

# Create mount directory if it doesn't exist
echo "Creating mount point at $MOUNT_POINT..."
sudo mkdir -p $MOUNT_POINT

# Test network connectivity with timeout
echo "Testing network connectivity to FSx endpoint..."
if timeout 10 ping -c 3 $FSX_DNS_NAME; then
    echo "Network connectivity test successful"
else
    echo "WARNING: Cannot ping FSx endpoint - continuing anyway"
fi

# Check if already mounted
if mount | grep -q "$MOUNT_POINT"; then
    echo "FSx for ONTAP is already mounted at $MOUNT_POINT"
else
    # Mount the FSx for ONTAP volume with timeout
    echo "Mounting FSx for ONTAP volume..."
    if timeout 60 sudo mount -t nfs -o $NFS_OPTIONS ${FSX_DNS_NAME}:${VOLUME_JUNCTION_PATH} $MOUNT_POINT; then
        echo "Mount command executed successfully"
    else
        mount_status=$?
        echo "Mount command failed with status $mount_status"
    fi
    
    # Verify mount
    if mount | grep -q "$MOUNT_POINT"; then
        echo "Mount verification successful at $(date)"
    else
        echo "Mount verification failed at $(date)"
    fi
fi

# Make mount persistent across reboots
echo "Adding entry to /etc/fstab..."
if ! grep -q "$MOUNT_POINT" /etc/fstab; then
    echo "${FSX_DNS_NAME}:${VOLUME_JUNCTION_PATH} $MOUNT_POINT nfs $NFS_OPTIONS,_netdev 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
    echo "Added fstab entry"
else
    echo "fstab entry already exists"
fi

# Display mount status
if mount | grep -q "$MOUNT_POINT"; then
    echo "Mount active: $(df -h $MOUNT_POINT)"
else
    echo "WARNING: Mount point is not active"
fi

# Always exit with success to prevent lifecycle configuration failure
echo "Script execution completed at $(date), exiting with status 0"
exit 0
```
